# Domain-Specific Examples

**Important**: These examples are **domain-specific** and are provided for illustration only. The core mdm-engine is domain-agnostic.

## Example Domains

### Content Moderation
- `CONTENT_MODERATION.md`: Content moderation pipeline example

### Robotics Control
- `ROBOTICS_CONTROL.md`: Robotics control system example

### Trading/Financial Markets (Example Only)
- `TRADING_DOMAIN.md`: Financial markets example (for reference only)

**Note**: All examples in this directory are optional and demonstrate how mdm-engine can be adapted to specific domains. Domain-specific logic should be implemented in adapters, not in core mdm-engine code.
